# ak-skills

A growing collection of generic, reusable Claude Code skills.

Each skill is a self-contained directory with its own `SKILL.md`, references, and templates. Skills are symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` so Claude Code discovers them in any project on this machine.

This repo is the generic counterpart to domain-specific skill repos (e.g. `flink-skills`). Anything domain-bound (Flink, a specific company, a specific stack) belongs elsewhere; this repo holds only skills that work on any codebase.

## Skills in this repo

| Skill | Purpose | Prereqs | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| [`plantuml/`](plantuml/) | Generate valid PlantUML for sequence, component, class, state, activity, deployment, ER, use case, and C4 diagrams. Elicits intent when ambiguous, routes by diagram type, enforces structural rules + anti-patterns, emits a render command. | — | active |
| [`system-design/`](system-design/) | Design real production systems end-to-end: elicit constraints → capacity estimate → data model & storage → architecture → scale the one bottleneck → failure modes → ADR-style decisions. Numbers first, anti-overengineering, "boring tech until a constraint forces otherwise." Not interview prep. | — | active |
| [`agent-ready/`](agent-ready/) | Prepare any repository for AI agents: generate a knowledge graph, write a cited `AGENT_DESIGN_DOC.md` (10 sections, every claim traced to `file:line`), optionally produce an `ARCHITECTURE.md` with validated Mermaid diagrams, wire `CLAUDE.md` with the design-doc import + Karpathy Guidelines, then commit only the generated files. Flags: `--skip-understand`, `--skip-commit`, `--architecture`, `--no-split`. | Claude Code plugin: [`Lum1104/Understand-Anything`](https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything) | active |
| [`connection-leak/`](connection-leak/) | Diagnose and fix connection leaks in JVM (Java/Kotlin) and Python services across three resource classes: JDBC/DB pools (HikariCP, asyncpg, SQLAlchemy), Apache Flink 1.18 operator lifecycle (`RichFunction.close`, AsyncIO, RocksDB iterators), and HTTP/gRPC clients (OkHttp, Apache HC, Netty, gRPC, ktor, aiohttp, httpx, requests). Runs cross-cutting triage (FD trend, FD classification, runtime ID) before routing to the matching domain reference. Replaces an earlier 4-skill family (`connection-leak-hunt` + 3 siblings). | — | active |

## Install

```bash
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` discovers every top-level directory containing a `SKILL.md` and creates a symlink at `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`. Adding a new skill = drop a new top-level directory + re-run `install.sh`.

If you also use Codex, Gemini CLI, or Copilot CLI (which read from `~/.agents/skills/`), pass `--also-agents` to mirror the symlinks there too:

```bash
./install.sh --also-agents
```

Verify:
```bash
ls -l ~/.claude/skills/
ls -l ~/.agents/skills/   # if you used --also-agents
```

Remove the symlinks (without deleting source):
```bash
./uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh --also-agents   # also remove the ~/.agents/skills/ mirror
```

`uninstall.sh` only removes symlinks pointing into THIS repo, so it's safe to run even if you have other skills installed from elsewhere.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create a new top-level directory (e.g. `mermaid/`).
2. Add a `SKILL.md` at its root with valid frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
3. Follow the authoring pattern documented in [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md): elicitation-first where intent is ambiguous, phase-routed where workflow has stages, templates separated from logic.
4. Re-run `./install.sh`.

## Validating a skill against open-source projects

When changing a skill, generate sample outputs against a handful of well-known open-source projects to eyeball the result before shipping. Drop them in `docs/skill-sample-outputs/`:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/skill-sample-outputs
# Have Claude apply the skill to e.g. Kafka, Redis, nginx, etc.
# Save the generated markdown / .puml / artifacts under that directory.
# Render and review.
```

`docs/skill-sample-outputs/` is gitignored — it's a local sandbox for manual validation, not a checked-in artifact. The repo-tracked equivalent is `evals/` inside each skill, which holds the formal eval set (skill-creator schema).
